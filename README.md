Exciting Project Completion!

I'm thrilled to share that our team has successfully completed a project on designing and building a Robo War BOT! for an National Level Robo War event held in our college. 

This project was an incredible opportunity to showcase our skills in:

Robotics and Automation
Mechanical Engineering
Programming and Coding
Innovation and Problem-Solving

Key Features:

- Custom-built chassis and mechanical components
- Integrated programming and control systems
- 3d designing and printing of BOT parts.

This project demonstrates our team's capability to design, develop, and deploy innovative robotic solutions. We're proud of our achievement and look forward to taking on new challenges!
